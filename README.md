Shinobi is a trojan that disguises itself as a normal picture, but when a victim opens the image, it will run a **python script** in the background, giving access to the attacker's machine. The attacker or attackers can then send a command via Discord, and it will execute on the victim's machine. **

# Shinobi can do the following:
- Lock user's machine
- Get user info
- Play background music to victim's machine
- Hijack victim's webcam
- Take a screenshot
- Check for open application then close it
- List all application victim's have
- Troll [just for fun]
- Delete all logs of the attack

# How to use shinobi
* Shinobi is plug-and play trojan software, which basically means all you need to do is send the payload or image to the victim, and the script will take over from there. Once the script is triggered, you should see a bot that will be online on your Discord server.

# How to use shinobi [for developers]
